1. Anything returned in the render() function is our view
2. Model view controller : View are all the render functions
    - Model is the state variable
    - controller are the functions like onChange etc etc.
3. Curly bracket means that whethever is inside should be treated/ parsed as an js.
4. we cannot directly change the value of the name (in example), because it will
change the value but will not update the whole view.

5. function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>Hello {this.state.name}</div>
  )
}

Here, we don't have access to the state object as the object is present in the
ProfileEditor class only.

6. <Greeting name={this.state.name} />
This is how we pass the name-value to another component. 

7. All the properties are passed as parameters to the function components

8. input component has the way of sending data from child to parent component
9. Button components send event(or a chang without data basically) to the parent component
(basically, it dependes on the callback that is sent to the method as the parameter)
